        <div id="Stepone"><h2>Step One: Understanding Words</h2>

        <p>The first step to learning "How to", is usually "What is", at least that's what I say! So... what <em>is</em> a word? Well, for ages, centries ago, there <em>were</em> no words! Well of course there were words, just not written ones. The ancient Sumerians were the first ones to bring their chisels to their stone tablets and <em>write.</em> This written language was an astronomical invention, as it made sending messages, saving laws, and recording events so much easier. The same still stands today, except now we have come up with even more ways to use writing to it's full potential. Entertainment, teaching, recipes, etc.. But in order to be able to exploit this brilliant invention, you have to be able to read it.</p>
        <p>So, we know the history, and the "why", so let's get to the "what". A letter is a bunch of dots, lines, and curves put together into a recognisable shape, and a word is made up of a combination of different letters. In the English language, there are 26 letters, A, B, C, etc.. That's a whole lot of memorizing you have to do just in order to read one word though! Well, don't fret, it's not so bad once you get the hang of it! And as long as you practice, eventually you will get the hang of it, so keep it up! Let's go over the simple terms and definitons that people may bring up when talking about written words:
            <ul>
                <li>Letter - a character representing one or more of the sounds used in speech; any of the symbols of an alphabet.</li>
                <li>Digraph - a combination of two letters representing one sound, as in ph and ey.</li>
                <li>Word - a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when written or printed.</li>
                <li>Sentence - a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.</li>
                <li>Paragraph - a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Overwhelming! Well not so much! You just gotta have it broken down into neat little bite-sized pieces for understanding! So bear with me.</p>
        <p>This: "A" ...is a letter, as we already stated. Three lines, simple, easy to understand! Well, this: "M" ...is also a letter. Got a few more lines, might be getting a little nervous now. But wait! There's more! This: "W" ...is also a letter! And a completely different one from the last. "What?" you may be asking, "It's exactly the same as the second one, just upside down!" Well my friend, that is an excellent observation! Many letters in the English alphebet look the same, except flipped or rotated, and this can cause problems for some people who have conditions or disablilities that cause the flipped letters to look the same, but as long as you don't have that it shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>
        <p>Now this: "Hello" ...is a word! Look at that! So many letters! This word is used as a simple greeting, along with other words, such as "Hi", or if you're feeling daring, "Hey"! Each word has a meaning, some words share meanings too, but you don't need to worry too much about that for now.</p>
        <p>Now let's speed through these other two definitions. This: "I am feeling kind of hungry today" ...is a sentence. That's a lot of words! Most written communication is made up of many sentences, so you should be prepared to see many of those big chunks of words, but don't worry, as once you can understand the meaning of the words themselves, the sentences are easy.</p>
        <p>Finally, a paragraph, is simply a cluster of sentences, typically used in books, laws, breakup texts, etc.. If you understand sentences, then you'll understand paragraphs!</p>

        <br><p>Phew! So much knowledge just in step one! But don't get too comfortable yet, as there's still more to learn! Now that you're familiar with letters, words, and sentences, we can start to get into what it takes to actually read them.</p>

        <div id="Steptwo"><h2>Step Two: How to read words</h2>

        <p>How to read words? Isn't that what this whole lesson is about? Well yes, but this isn't the final step, so don't get ahead of yourself! You have learned much about words, but now, what does it take to read them? Well first off, you need some words to read, so let's go back to that first example.</p>
        
        <div class="Beequote"><p>-According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.-</p></div><!--End of Beequote-->

        <p>Now, that should look familiar, because if you scroll up, it's right at the top! See it? Anyways, let's try reading it. The first thing you're going to want to do, is look at that first word, at the very top-left of the example text. Now, most things are read left to right, and top to bottom, so let's do it like that! Now, make sure your eyes on on that top-left word, and now for the tricky part, you're going to want to read that first word. Look at each letter, left to right, and try to sound them out. If you don't know what sound each one makes, I suggest you get someone to help you sound them out. It's a bit of a long word so take your time! Now when you've sounded out each letter, try saying it again, but all the letters bunched up into one word this time. Did you get it? The word is "According". See? Simple!</p>
        <p>Alright now that you've read that first word, you just repeat the same steps for the one to the right of it, then after that, the one to the right of that one! You do this again, and again, and again, until... Oh! Well would you look at that? There's no more words to the right! Whenever this happens, you go all the way back to the left, and then look below that line the the one directly underneath, and you read all the words down there from left to right, same as the top!</p>
        <p>Well would you look at that! You read that whole thing! Make sure to give yourself a good pat on the back, you're doing well! So, you may be thinking: "Wow! I can read now! I can finally be a functioning member of society!" Well now hold up a second! We're not done! There's still a bit more to it, so let's hurry up and finish this off before your attention span completely dwindles away.</p>

        <div id="Stepthree"><h2>Step Three: Understanding what you're reading</h2>
        
        <p>So, you read something, but do you know <em>what</em> you read? That's what this final step is about, understanding what it is that you're reading. It takes more than to just be able to read, because that's useless if you don't know what it is that you're reading! So, how do we understand it then? Well I'll tell you!</p>
        <p>First things first, you're going to want to recognise each word as you read it. "According", now what could that mean? Well assuming you can talk, maybe you've heard of that word before? What about "laws"? Ooh that's a nasty one isn't it? Well, each written word is simply a spoken one, but in written form! So the same way you take in a sentence that someone says to you, you would take in one that you're reading! Try to recognise each word, what they individually mean, and what they mean paired together, then string them all together in your head, and understand the meaning it's trying to convey! Yeah, that sounds complicated again, doesn't it? Well let's start with something smaller and break it down again.</p>
        <p>Try this example: "I fell off my bike today and scratched my knee." Can you read it? Go back to step two if you need a reminder on how. Now, assuming that you've read that whole thing, what does it mean? First step is understanding the individual words, same order as reading it! "I", what does that mean? Well that's a letter of course! But we're not talking about the definition of the form, we're talking about the meaning the word is trying to convey! "I" refers to the person speaking. Nice! Now, what about the next word? "Fell". Well, that means to fall, so keep that in mind. Now go through each word with this process until you are familiar with the meaning for each one. Alright, now that you've done that, what next?</p>
        <p>Now, you're going to want to do it again, but instead of each individual word, what do the words mean when paired together in the ways that they are? "I fell", what does that mean? Well, remember what they mean individually? Try pairing together those meanings! The person who is speaking, fell! Now you're starting to get it aren't you? continue this process, understanding word pairings, gradually stiching the meanings of everything together more and more until you have one concrete meaning the sentence is trying to convey! This sentence is saying that someone fell off of their bike earlier that day, and hurt their knee! Ouch! Good job though, you're doing great!</p>
        <p>We're almost done here, bet you're feeling excited now aren't you? Or bored, either one. So, remember what I meantioned earlier? Paragraphs? Well when you're dealing with a paragraph, most often, you will have to keep track of what is happening throughout the whole thing, and remember what happened in previous sentences within the paragraph. Hard work! But don't worry, it get's easier with practice! Reading is hard sometimes, so make sure to go at your own pace and get used to it, and eventually, you will get faster, and you'll do better, and then maybe, just maybe, you'll be at average reading level for people of your age! In order to get there however, you're going to have to make it through some obstacles, such as keeping track of multiple people within one or more paragraphs, long words, synonyms, grammar, all that stuff! These are things that every person has to get the hang of however, so don't be discouraged, keep at it and you'll get there!</p>
        <p>Now, I'm afraid this is where we'll have to part ways, so remember to keep up the good work, practice a lot, and ask for help where needed! Maybe we shall meet again when you need help with another skill you should already be proficient in! But until then, goodbye!
